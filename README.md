# busAnimation

This uses an array with coordinates for the map image printed on the screen. As the program continues it places and moves a little arrow displaying the locaton of the bus stops between MIT and Harvard

How to run: Click the "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" button to start the interval time revealing the locations of yhe bus stops.

Future Improvements: Allow the user to add addresses to show different types of locations between the two (not just bus stops).
